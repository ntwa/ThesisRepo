\section{Introduction}
Obesity and overweight are currently global health concerns. A systematic review by~\cite{guh2009incidence} concluded that both overweight and obesity are associated with increased incidence of multiple co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).  The risk of developing a number of obesity-related co-morbidities rises exponentially with increasing BMI over 30 kg/m\SP{2}, which is further associated with a graded increase in the relative risk of premature death, primarily from CVD~\citep{de2000clinical}. Co-morbidities that are associated with obesity are likely to inundate health care systems as the number of people who are considered to be either overweight or obese stands to an approximation of  1.3 billion people~\citep{steyn2006chronic}. This calls for innovative interventions to support health,  promotion and self-management.
