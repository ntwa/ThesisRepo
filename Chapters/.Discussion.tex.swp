\section{Discussion}
Informative evaluations revealed that involving children who are family member is the key to success of this intervention. This idea of collaborative interfaces for health information within family settings is prevalent in computer supported collaborative work literature. \cite{colineau2011motivating} designed a system to support a family to select a collective health goal and receive feedbacks that entailed comparisons between families. Their system was found to encourage members from within a family or members of different families, to work together and in particular to help each other in finding ways to live a healthily lifestyle.
