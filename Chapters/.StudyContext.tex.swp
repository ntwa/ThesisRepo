\section{Obesity in South Africa}
A person is considered obese if their body mass index (BMI) is >30 kg/m2 [1]. BMI is the ratio of a personâ€™s weight in kilograms over their height in meters (m) squared.  BMI is strongly correlated with total body fat content in adults of age 35 years and older [3].
Most of apartheid policies towards health didn't focus towards these populations and some of the current health and economical concerns are as result of amplifications of apartheid social clusters \citep{benatar2013challenges}. 

The risk of developing a number of obesity-related co-morbidities rises exponentially with increasing BMI over 30 kg/m\SP{2}, which is further associated with an increase in the relative risk of premature death, primarily from CVD~\citep{de2000clinical}.
