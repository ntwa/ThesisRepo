There is an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that are associated with living unhealthy lifestyle in both developed and developing world contexts. In order to help combat this unfavourable trend, public health researchers are advocating towards shifting care to the hands of citizens through utilization of personalized interventions . The objective of these initiatives is to support individuals beyond the point of care. ICTs, specifically mobile phones coupled with sophisticated persuasive mechanisms such as gamification or simple strategies such as SMS reminders provide an opportune platform for delivery of personalized interventions that target health behaviour change. In order to support delivery of such personalized interventions, researchers in human-computer interaction have developed an area of research referred to as personal informatics, which focuses on data collection and feedback mechanisms. These approaches aim at supporting individuals to be able to quantify different aspects of their lives through self-reflection. These systems have been developed with motivational affordance to sustain their utilization by end users. However, such systems are developed with only one user in mind of which is a direct user of technology. Such systems may not scale well in contexts of indirect users of technology, meaning people who use technology through a facilitation of a human interface (intermediary user) situated between indirect users (beneficiaries of technology) and technology. Therefore, there was a need to explore how motivational affordance of a personal health informatics could be extended to work in the context of an interaction that requires a collaboration that leads to indirect usage. This was a collaboration between the person helping and the person being helped.

In order to understand design implications for indirect technology use in the context of a personal health informatics, several approaches were used to understand social dynamics that could affect utilization of technology through a human interface in between indirect users and technology. Prototypes of mobile self monitoring applications for physical activity and diet were developed and used as the starting point for uncovering unknown issues. As the result of evaluation of the aforementioned prototypes , the researcher suggested both social technical arrangements and prerequisites that increase the likelihood of success in utilization of such interventions. One of the important social technical arrangement was a prior social relationship between a human interface and a beneficiary of technology through a human interface. Self-determination theory was used to understand how motivation for collaboration between the two sets of users (the human interface and beneficiary user of technology ) could be enhanced. Gamification, a design pattern inspired by games  was found to be the source of a significant increase in perceived competence, an aspect of self-determination theory. Therefore, gamification was found to be a catalyst for increasing collaboration between a human interface and beneficiary user of technology provided that the two users that form a pair had a prior social relationship. The collaborative gamified system showed promising results towards utilization of personal health informatics in the context of indirect usage. The most promising combination of a human interface and beneficiary user is the one that entails family members, possibly a child and a parent.

Despite the success of gamification in increasing perceived competence of the human interface, and hence collaboration between a human interface and beneficiary user, there are some design implications that need to be taken into consideration in order to understand how internalization of collaboration between two members of a pair working together could be improved. This entails exploration of features that support task mastery climate versus those that support ego-involved. Future research could also explore how different styles of parenting could affect the way the intervention is perceived by the two sets of users.

\acknowledgements{\addtocontents{toc}{\vspace{1em}} % Add a gap in the Contents, for aesthetics

The first people to acknowledge are my research supervisors for their guidance and wisdom in my difficult PhD journey;Dr Melissa Densmore and Prof. Ulrike Rivett. I would like to extent my acknowledgement to the Late Prof. Gary Marsden who was my main supervisor before his demise. May his soul rest in peace. Through him that is where I started to build the passion for human-computer interaction. He was more that just a supervisor. He welcome us as a group to his his home and we became like part of his family. I would like to also to acknowledge his widow, Gil Marsden together two children made us feel at home while in Cape Town.

I would also like to acknowledge all colleagues at ICT4D Lab, University of Cape Town (UCT) whom within their presence the lab was not only an academic environment but we were like one big family supporting each other. Special acknowledgements goes to Christopher Chepken, Raymond Mughwanya, Grace Ssekakubo, Richard Ssembatya, Mvurya Mgala, Thomas Reitmaier, and many more whose names I have not mentioned here but I appreciate their contribution. Also special acknowledgements goes to the ICOMMS research group of which of I was part of.  

I also acknowledge Craig Balfour, a system administrator at the department for his technical support on the infrastructure for hosting the application online. Special thanks also goes Eve Gill, the financial administrator at the Department of Computer Science for being effective in processing funds whenever they were required. Also I would like to thank HPI Research School and Centre of Excellence both at UCT for their generous scholarship, and travel and research grants that were very instrumental in facilitation of my PhD journey. My acknowledgement are extended Memalani NGO in Cape Town who played a role in recruitment of participants at some stage of role. In additional to Mamelani, special thanks go to Mrs Minah Radebe of Langa in  Cape Town and her field worker who were both very instrumental in assisting towards recruitment of participants and facilitation of evaluation in general.

The last group of people I would like to pass my acknowledgement are my country mates at University Cape Town who made my stay in Cape Town appear like a home far from home.
