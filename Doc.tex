Prior social relationship was instrumental in facilitation of negotiation for interaction between members of a pair (an intermediary user and a beneficiary user). Before an interaction took place there was always a negotiation for interaction; hence presence or absence of a prior social relationship was a determinant of whether a negotiation would be successful or not. Negotiations would be initiated within a pair by either member of a pair. Once a negotiation to initiate interaction was successful then intermediary users navigated through the app. In the process of navigating through the app, anything intermediaries found interesting would be shared with their respective beneficiary users.

This kind of sharing sparked a conversation between the two users (members of a pair). As the result of sharing information between members of a pair there was a collaborative reflection which increase engagement of intermediaries and promoted a bond between intermediary and beneficiary through motivational affordances that are either directly situated in the app or indirectly situated in the app (i.e social comparison among beneficiaries that had formed an informal social support group).
